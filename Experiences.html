<h2>Graph Representation Learning for Time Series Forecasting</h2>
<i>Research Assistant</i> at Machine Learning and Robotics Group<br />
University of Manchester, Manchester, UK, Oct. 2020 - Present<br />
Advisor: Prof. Xiao-Jun Zeng<br />

<ul>
<li>Proposed weighting scheme for time series encoding by mapping binary relations into weighted networks, which overcomes information loss of graph mapping.</li>
<li>Extended single-layer graph to multiplex networks, and introduced intra-layer and inter-layer similarities to extracts past and recent sequential knowledge.</li>
<li>Introduced <i>ProbAttention</i> mechanism to evaluate probabilistic attention distribution for multi-variate long-term sequence modeling and forecasting.</li>
</ul></li>




<h2>Decision Making Under Uncertainty in Complex Systems</h2>
<i>Research Intern</i> at Center for Mathematics and Systems Science<br />
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, CN, Jun. 2019 - Sep. 2019<br />
Advisor: Prof. Yong Deng<br />

<ul>
<li>Addressed inner and outer dependence in evidence theory under uncertainty, and achieved higher sensitivity and accuracy in transportation project selection.</li>
<li>Developed a decision-making framework applicable to complex systems, applying to products and process strategies selection for produced water management.</li>
</ul></li>




<h2>Time Series Fusion and Prediction by Complex Networks</h2>
<i>Research Assistant</i> at Information Fusion and Intelligent System Lab<br />
Southwest University, Chongqing, CN, Mar. 2018 - Jun. 2020<br />
Advisor: Prof. Yong Deng and Prof. Fuyuan Xiao<br />

<ul>
<li>Investigate time series data via complex networks analysis, exploring potential links in temporal networks by link prediction based on random walk.</li>
<li>Proposed network-based models for time series aggregation and improved predictive accuracy on real-world datasets, offering a novel promising avenue of network forecasting.</li>
</ul>
